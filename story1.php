<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a late afternoon in February, and three young men lounge on the deck of an <strong>old boat</strong> with peeling white paint moored along Brazil’s Puruê River, deep in the Amazon near the southernmost tip of Colombia. Tied to the boat is a battered, barn-like structure housing a tangle of chutes and gears and mounted on a barge. This is a mining dredge, one of scores along this narrow, winding river. Illegal and destructive, they churn up the riverbed, producing tens of millions of dollars’ worth of gold every month. This one is idle, though, awaiting repairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reporters from Amazon Underworld are talking with the miners on the dredge, when just before sunset, the silence is broken by the sound of a powerful outboard motor as a smaller boat pulls up, a uniformed man wearing a balaclava and wielding a Brazilian-made assault rifle standing on the prow. He and five companions leap aboard the miners’ boat. Identifying themselves as a Brazilian Military Police river patrol, they pat down the miners, order them to fix a meal and settle in for the night.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the police officers wolf down plates of canned meatballs with tomato sauce and dried cassava meal, the owner of the mining dredge arrives, a man known as Cabeludo, a nickname taken from the gray hair he ties back in a ponytail. For the miner, the boat and dredge are both his business and the home he shares with his wife, months-old baby, a cook and eight workers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He seems to take the uniformed intruders in stride, even when one pulls out a mobile phone and passes around a photo that is circulating in a WhatsApp group. It’s a corpse. Just hours earlier, he says, the owner of a mining dredge was murdered, allegedly by one of his workers, who fled into the jungle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He took half a kilo of gold with him,” one of the officers says.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the 1990s, most of the illegal gold mining in this region, where Colombia’s Puré River becomes Brazil’s Rio Puruê and flows into the Japurá, was done by small-scale prospectors. But with the rise in gold prices in the early 2000s, organized crime groups cashed in on the lucrative industry, including Colombian guerrillas who saw illegal gold mining as a way to launder profits from the drug trade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a dissident guerrilla group began building a new criminal enterprise, financing their ongoing armed violence in part by shaking down illegal miners for what they called “voluntary contributions.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some time back, the Brazilian Army faced off with guerrillas on the Puruê River, recalls Getúlio,* a miner from São Paulo who operates an industrial-scale dredge — called a draga in Portuguese and Spanish — about six times the size of Cabeludo’s.</p>

<p>As Getúlio sips a fresh cup of coffee, thousands of gallons of muddy water clatter down a metal chute behind him. The miner owns two colossal dragas, which can produce kilos of gold a month, dwarfing the tens of grams produced by smaller dredges like Cabeludo’s, which are known as balsas. He knows that makes him a target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The guerrillas came to this river, collecting taxes from miners,” Gétulio says. He digs out a receipt that says he made a&nbsp; “voluntary contribution” of 40 grams of gold. The small piece of paper, which features a photo of legendary FARC commander Mono Jojoy, notes that the gold was paid to the “Comisión Miller Perdomo,” which belongs to the FARC dissident group headed by a guerrilla leader known as Iván Mordisco.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first, the guerrillas collected 20 grams of gold a month, but soon they began to demand 20 grams a week. “They took what they wanted to take,” the miner says.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the miners, the situation was getting out of hand. “They used threats and intimidation to collect the tax. The garimpeiros warned the guerrillas that the army was coming to clear them out,” he adds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2021, the Brazilian Army responded by sweeping the guerrillas from most of the Puruê River. “There was a confrontation here,” Getúlio says. “The Brazilian Army and Navy stayed here on the Puruê River for three months.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brazilian authorities have been tight-lipped about the operation. In an <strong>official statement</strong>, the Federal Police gave no details except to say that nine people were arrested, including “two dissidents from a foreign guerrilla group,” and authorities seized a kilo of gold, cash, weapons, ammunition, mercury and cocaine base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They went up the river and killed everyone they saw. After that operation, the Colombians didn’t come back,” one miner says. But there’s no guarantee that the guerrillas will not return, as they reportedly still extort payments from miners upriver, closer to the border, the garimpeiros say.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But according to the miners, extortion did not end when the guerrillas left. Nowadays, they say, they&nbsp; pay protection money to the military police, as well as to local authorities. Getulio and two other miners along the Puruê River claimed that they paid the Military Police 30 grams of gold per dredge monthly for protection, and another amount up to 50 grams to the prefect in Japurá. Getúlio says the payments are part of a deal in which the miners pay for a boat and fuel for police to patrol the river and the mining area. “I help the security forces so they will also help me,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an emailed response to questions about the accusations, Japurá’s municipal secretary of administration and coordination, Renilton Dos Santos Solarth, called them “fanciful rumors lacking in veracity.” He said the municipality has received no reports of public servants illegally receiving gold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Military Police responded to an inquiry by stating that police have conducted operations to investigate piracy, resulting in the arrest of several offenders, including Military Police personnel. They did not respond to questions about claims that Military Police officials extorted payments in gold from illegal miners.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the Military Police’s regular stops is the garimpeiro settlement of Purezinho, which consists of several modest wooden houses and two floating brothels known as barcos de amor or “love boats.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a lazy morning, reporters from Amazon Underworld watch as half a dozen Military Police officers mill around in Purezinho. The commanding officer, wearing flip-flops, walks along the riverbank, followed closely by a colleague, his automatic weapon at the ready and a balaclava concealing his face.“Everything here is illegal,” the commanding officer says, making it very clear who is in charge. “I can do whatever I want here.”</p>

<p>The violent microcosm of guerrillas, pirates and rogue police officers reflects the lack of governance in this corner of the Brazilian state of Amazonas. The municipality of Japurá, the largest town in the area, with an official population of less than 2,000, has the 12th-highest homicide rate in the country, at 114 per 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides guerrillas and corrupt police, another threat are the bands of heavily armed pirates who also roam the rivers, especially targeting miners, as well as the occasional boat carrying cocaine and marijuana from Colombia. Getúlio says he once lost 130 grams of gold and his wife’s jewelry to seven armed pirates on the Japurá River. “They shot at us from a distance, but missed,” he says. “They overtook us, overpowered us and demanded the gold.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pirates make river travel dangerous for others, as well. A representative of a non-profit organization working in the area recounts a narrow escape in which he and his wife barely managed to beach their boat and flee into the forest to escape a boat with a high-power motor that was bearing down on them. Pirates have warned people in local communities to stay off the river after 4 p.m., he says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miners and local boat pilots claim some of the pirates are police officers — “more pirate than the pirates,” one experienced boatman in the Japurá municipality says. In July 2022, five Military Police officers were detained and suspended for the crime of piracy. The Justice and Discipline Office of the Military Police of Amazonas State opened an investigation into the case nine months later, after Amazon Underworld inquired about it.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“I like having a car and motorcycle and enjoying a Heineken at a nice restaurant,” one miner said. “I worked hard for it — it’s not to show off. If you had the chance, you would, too. Don’t judge us. It’s the only way to earn good money here.”</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE ‘IRREVERSIBLE’</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On both sides of the Colombian-Brazilian border where the Puré River becomes the Puruê, areas set aside to protect forests — and people living in them — are threatened by illegal mining on the river. On the Brazil side, the Puruê River falls under the jurisdiction of the Amazonas state government and the Brazilian Army, while the Juami River, a nearby mining hotspot, is inside the Juami-Japurá Ecological Station, a protected area managed by the federal government.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides the dredges that operate with impunity along the rivers, in some places miners with heavy equipment are pushing their way into the forest, threatening to turn the tropical landscape into a moonscape devoid of vegetation and pocked with water-filled craters. Calculations by the non-profit Amazon Conservation Team, which has an office in Brasília, indicate that about 1,010 hectares of forest have been destroyed by illegal mining along the Puruê River.

<p>“There has been a general abandonment of the region in recent years, which has facilitated the entrance of all kinds of criminals, such as river pirates, drug dealers, and gold miners,” says Joel Araujo, who heads the government environmental agency IBAMA in the state of Amazonas. “Violence has grown a lot and criminality has taken the place of the state, co-opting young people and entire communities along the rivers.”</p>

<p>During the Bolsonaro administration, the country’s main environmental agencies were headed by police officials who dismantled infrastructure and closed checkpoints, including one near the Juami-Japurá Ecological Station. It was still closed in June, six months after Bolsonaro left office, but government officials said they planned to reopen it.</p>

<p>On the Colombian side of the border, the government lost control over the Puré River after FARC dissidents ordered park rangers to abandon Puré National Park in 2020. “Because of the threats posed by the existence of the FARC, park rangers are unable to protect the parks,” the park’s director, Eliana Martínez Rueda says, adding that the guerrillas issued new threats and restrictions in January 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Puré National Park was created in part to protect the Yuri-Passé, a semi-nomadic Indigenous group that shuns contact with outsiders. But with the rangers gone, dredges began to encroach on the area, and illegal mining continues there. The Colombian Navy, Army and Police did not respond to requests for information.</p>

<p>Drug traffickers use the park’s rivers and there are clandestine airstrips in the area, Martínez says. Illegal miners also cross the border from Brazil into the park. “It’s already a no man’s land,” she adds, “and they enter Colombia easily.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She worries that the Yurí-Passé, a small tribe, could be wiped out by violence or disease if contacted by armed groups or illegal miners. “It’s a health risk, because [outsiders] can bring diseases for which [the Yuri-Passé] have not developed immunity,” she says.</p>

<p>“Governments don’t have control or authority, so lots of these remote areas have allowed illegal mining groups and other illegal mafias to flourish, especially in transboundary regions,” says Brian Hettler, a geographer and cartographer with the non-profit Amazon Conservation Team, who has been mapping the presence of illegal mining dredges, says the environmental damage they cause is “irreversible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The environmental damage being done by illegal mining is largely irreversible,” he adds. “It will take many decades to dissipate, so these miners are literally changing the courses of rivers, altering the natural sedimentation processes developed over many decades.”</p>

<p>Miners also dump mercury into rivers, where it is consumed by fish that forage along the river bed, then accumulates in the tissues of fish or other animals that feed on them. “The oldest and largest fish, typically at the top of the food chain, show the highest rates of contamination, and these are often the species that people like to eat, meaning that contamination is then passed on to the people,” Hettler says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mercury causes digestive and neurological problems and can cross the placenta, affecting a developing fetus. Some Amazonian fish travel long distances, so fish with high levels of mercury can affect people living far from mining areas, including isolated groups like the Yuri-Passé, Hettler says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 2018 study of hair samples taken from Indigenous people in the Colombian Amazon near the Brazilian border found that about 90% of the community members had levels of mercury exceeding the maximum threshold recommended by the World Health Organization, in some cases by as much as four times.</p>

<p>Estimates of gold production for an industrial-scale dredge on Brazil’s Puruê River vary widely, but conservative calculations range from about 2.5 to 3 kilograms (5.5 to 6.6 pounds) a month. According to interviews with miners, law enforcement officials and gold traders in the state of Amazonas state, illegal gold is funneled through a complex network of intermediaries, gold shops and transporters.</p>

<p>Living on the dredges for months at a time, miners give the structures touches of home, keeping pets, tending small gardens of lettuce and scallions, and raising chickens for food. Cooks bake fresh bread and keep the miners supplied with jugs of sweetened coffee.</p>

<p>A Military Police officer who asked to remain anonymous claims to escort shipments of illegally mined gold on private flights from the town of Japurá to Amazonian cities such as Porto Velho, Boa Vista and Manaus, where buyers receive the precious metal without inquiring about its origin.</p>

<p>“The transport is simple. Every day, flights depart from Japurá and we safely transport the draga owner’s gold, which we call ‘big gold,’ to the capital where we can get the best price for it,” he says. Japurá’s airport has permission from Brazil's National Civil Aviation Agency to handle only private flights. Smugglers face a higher risk of detection when they land at larger airports where government inspectors are stationed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Military Police officer, who is from a large and economically poor family in the state of Amazonas, sees gold mining as a solution to poverty in the region.&nbsp; “It’s illegal, but not immoral,” he says. “It should be legalized, because now [miners] don’t pay taxes and the money doesn’t stay with the people of Amazonas. It ends up going abroad.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the gold leaves the Amazon, it usually is melted and molded into rectangular bars that weigh one kilogram (2.2 pounds) each and can fit in an adult’s hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if law enforcement operations destroy a dredge, the activity can still be profitable. According to miners, it costs about US$500,000 to US$600,000 to build a large draga in the Japurá region—a sum the owner of a highly productive dredge can recoup in a few months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those involved, the potential payoff is worth the risk, and the huge amounts of money involved underscore the difficulty of reining in the illegal mining that has extended throughout the Amazon.</p>
