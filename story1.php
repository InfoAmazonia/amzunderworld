<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a late afternoon in February, and three young men lounge on the deck of an <strong>old boat</strong> with peeling white paint moored along Brazil’s Puruê River, deep in the Amazon near the southernmost tip of Colombia. Tied to the boat is a battered, barn-like structure housing a tangle of chutes and gears and mounted on a barge. This is a mining dredge, one of scores along this narrow, winding river. Illegal and destructive, they churn up the riverbed, producing tens of millions of dollars’ worth of gold every month. This one is idle, though, awaiting repairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reporters from Amazon Underworld are talking with the miners on the dredge, when just before sunset, the silence is broken by the sound of a powerful outboard motor as a smaller boat pulls up, a uniformed man wearing a balaclava and wielding a Brazilian-made assault rifle standing on the prow. He and five companions leap aboard the miners’ boat. Identifying themselves as a Brazilian Military Police river patrol, they pat down the miners, order them to fix a meal and settle in for the night.</p>

<p>As the police officers wolf down plates of canned meatballs with tomato sauce and dried cassava meal, the owner of the mining dredge arrives, a man known as Cabeludo, a nickname taken from the gray hair he ties back in a ponytail. For the miner, the boat and dredge are both his business and the home he shares with his wife, months-old baby, a cook and eight workers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He seems to take the uniformed intruders in stride, even when one pulls out a mobile phone and passes around a photo that is circulating in a WhatsApp group. It’s a corpse. Just hours earlier, he says, the owner of a mining dredge was murdered, allegedly by one of his workers, who fled into the jungle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He took half a kilo of gold with him,” one of the officers says.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the 1990s, most of the illegal gold mining in this region, where Colombia’s Puré River becomes Brazil’s Rio Puruê and flows into the Japurá, was done by small-scale prospectors. But with the rise in gold prices in the early 2000s, organized crime groups cashed in on the lucrative industry, including Colombian guerrillas who saw illegal gold mining as a way to launder profits from the drug trade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a dissident guerrilla group began building a new criminal enterprise, financing their ongoing armed violence in part by shaking down illegal miners for what they called “voluntary contributions.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some time back, the Brazilian Army faced off with guerrillas on the Puruê River, recalls Getúlio,* a miner from São Paulo who operates an industrial-scale dredge — called a draga in Portuguese and Spanish — about six times the size of Cabeludo’s.</p>

<p>As Getúlio sips a fresh cup of coffee, thousands of gallons of muddy water clatter down a metal chute behind him. The miner owns two colossal dragas, which can produce kilos of gold a month, dwarfing the tens of grams produced by smaller dredges like Cabeludo’s, which are known as balsas. He knows that makes him a target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The guerrillas came to this river, collecting taxes from miners,” Gétulio says. He digs out a receipt that says he made a&nbsp; “voluntary contribution” of 40 grams of gold. The small piece of paper, which features a photo of legendary FARC commander Mono Jojoy, notes that the gold was paid to the “Comisión Miller Perdomo,” which belongs to the FARC dissident group headed by a guerrilla leader known as Iván Mordisco.</p>
