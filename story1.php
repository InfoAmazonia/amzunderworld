<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a late afternoon in February, and three young men lounge on the deck of an <strong>old boat</strong> with peeling white paint moored along Brazil’s Puruê River, deep in the Amazon near the southernmost tip of Colombia. Tied to the boat is a battered, barn-like structure housing a tangle of chutes and gears and mounted on a barge. This is a mining dredge, one of scores along this narrow, winding river. Illegal and destructive, they churn up the riverbed, producing tens of millions of dollars’ worth of gold every month. This one is idle, though, awaiting repairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reporters from Amazon Underworld are talking with the miners on the dredge, when just before sunset, the silence is broken by the sound of a powerful outboard motor as a smaller boat pulls up, a uniformed man wearing a balaclava and wielding a Brazilian-made assault rifle standing on the prow. He and five companions leap aboard the miners’ boat. Identifying themselves as a Brazilian Military Police river patrol, they pat down the miners, order them to fix a meal and settle in for the night.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the police officers wolf down plates of canned meatballs with tomato sauce and dried cassava meal, the owner of the mining dredge arrives, a man known as Cabeludo, a nickname taken from the gray hair he ties back in a ponytail. For the miner, the boat and dredge are both his business and the home he shares with his wife, months-old baby, a cook and eight workers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He seems to take the uniformed intruders in stride, even when one pulls out a mobile phone and passes around a photo that is circulating in a WhatsApp group. It’s a corpse. Just hours earlier, he says, the owner of a mining dredge was murdered, allegedly by one of his workers, who fled into the jungle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He took half a kilo of gold with him,” one of the officers says.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the 1990s, most of the illegal gold mining in this region, where Colombia’s Puré River becomes Brazil’s Rio Puruê and flows into the Japurá, was done by small-scale prospectors. But with the rise in gold prices in the early 2000s, organized crime groups cashed in on the lucrative industry, including Colombian guerrillas who saw illegal gold mining as a way to launder profits from the drug trade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a dissident guerrilla group began building a new criminal enterprise, financing their ongoing armed violence in part by shaking down illegal miners for what they called “voluntary contributions.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some time back, the Brazilian Army faced off with guerrillas on the Puruê River, recalls Getúlio,* a miner from São Paulo who operates an industrial-scale dredge — called a draga in Portuguese and Spanish — about six times the size of Cabeludo’s.</p>

<p>As Getúlio sips a fresh cup of coffee, thousands of gallons of muddy water clatter down a metal chute behind him. The miner owns two colossal dragas, which can produce kilos of gold a month, dwarfing the tens of grams produced by smaller dredges like Cabeludo’s, which are known as balsas. He knows that makes him a target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The guerrillas came to this river, collecting taxes from miners,” Gétulio says. He digs out a receipt that says he made a&nbsp; “voluntary contribution” of 40 grams of gold. The small piece of paper, which features a photo of legendary FARC commander Mono Jojoy, notes that the gold was paid to the “Comisión Miller Perdomo,” which belongs to the FARC dissident group headed by a guerrilla leader known as Iván Mordisco.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first, the guerrillas collected 20 grams of gold a month, but soon they began to demand 20 grams a week. “They took what they wanted to take,” the miner says.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the miners, the situation was getting out of hand. “They used threats and intimidation to collect the tax. The garimpeiros warned the guerrillas that the army was coming to clear them out,” he adds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2021, the Brazilian Army responded by sweeping the guerrillas from most of the Puruê River. “There was a confrontation here,” Getúlio says. “The Brazilian Army and Navy stayed here on the Puruê River for three months.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brazilian authorities have been tight-lipped about the operation. In an <strong>official statement</strong>, the Federal Police gave no details except to say that nine people were arrested, including “two dissidents from a foreign guerrilla group,” and authorities seized a kilo of gold, cash, weapons, ammunition, mercury and cocaine base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They went up the river and killed everyone they saw. After that operation, the Colombians didn’t come back,” one miner says. But there’s no guarantee that the guerrillas will not return, as they reportedly still extort payments from miners upriver, closer to the border, the garimpeiros say.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But according to the miners, extortion did not end when the guerrillas left. Nowadays, they say, they&nbsp; pay protection money to the military police, as well as to local authorities. Getulio and two other miners along the Puruê River claimed that they paid the Military Police 30 grams of gold per dredge monthly for protection, and another amount up to 50 grams to the prefect in Japurá. Getúlio says the payments are part of a deal in which the miners pay for a boat and fuel for police to patrol the river and the mining area. “I help the security forces so they will also help me,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an emailed response to questions about the accusations, Japurá’s municipal secretary of administration and coordination, Renilton Dos Santos Solarth, called them “fanciful rumors lacking in veracity.” He said the municipality has received no reports of public servants illegally receiving gold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Military Police responded to an inquiry by stating that police have conducted operations to investigate piracy, resulting in the arrest of several offenders, including Military Police personnel. They did not respond to questions about claims that Military Police officials extorted payments in gold from illegal miners.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the Military Police’s regular stops is the garimpeiro settlement of Purezinho, which consists of several modest wooden houses and two floating brothels known as barcos de amor or “love boats.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a lazy morning, reporters from Amazon Underworld watch as half a dozen Military Police officers mill around in Purezinho. The commanding officer, wearing flip-flops, walks along the riverbank, followed closely by a colleague, his automatic weapon at the ready and a balaclava concealing his face.“Everything here is illegal,” the commanding officer says, making it very clear who is in charge. “I can do whatever I want here.”</p>

<p>The violent microcosm of guerrillas, pirates and rogue police officers reflects the lack of governance in this corner of the Brazilian state of Amazonas. The municipality of Japurá, the largest town in the area, with an official population of less than 2,000, has the 12th-highest homicide rate in the country, at 114 per 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides guerrillas and corrupt police, another threat are the bands of heavily armed pirates who also roam the rivers, especially targeting miners, as well as the occasional boat carrying cocaine and marijuana from Colombia. Getúlio says he once lost 130 grams of gold and his wife’s jewelry to seven armed pirates on the Japurá River. “They shot at us from a distance, but missed,” he says. “They overtook us, overpowered us and demanded the gold.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pirates make river travel dangerous for others, as well. A representative of a non-profit organization working in the area recounts a narrow escape in which he and his wife barely managed to beach their boat and flee into the forest to escape a boat with a high-power motor that was bearing down on them. Pirates have warned people in local communities to stay off the river after 4 p.m., he says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miners and local boat pilots claim some of the pirates are police officers — “more pirate than the pirates,” one experienced boatman in the Japurá municipality says. In July 2022, five Military Police officers were detained and suspended for the crime of piracy. The Justice and Discipline Office of the Military Police of Amazonas State opened an investigation into the case nine months later, after Amazon Underworld inquired about it.</p>
